firebase-php
============

Forked from Ktamas77's Firebase-PHP (https://github.com/ktamas77/firebase-php) package. This fork automatically converts Firebase responses into an associative array instead of pure JSON strings. It also has been Composer-ified so you can easily drop this in an existing PHP project with Composer.
